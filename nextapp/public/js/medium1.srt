1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:07,560
 Imagine a student from a remote part of J&K and Ladakh, full of hope, applying for a scholarship

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,560
 that would change their lives.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,600
 Instead of focusing on the studies, they are caught in a frustrating cycle, printing documents,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,560
 traveling to verification centers and waiting for approvals that seem to take forever.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,240
 The process is slow, confusing and full of paperwork, often leading to delays that leave

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
 students in a limbo.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,520
 But it's not just the students facing the challenges.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,280
 On the other side, the FC center is overwhelmed with the task of manually verifying thousands

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
 of documents from the applicants.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,720
 Imagine an alternative, a system where students can apply for their scholarships from the

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
 home.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,240
 The workflow documents digitally and track their application status in real time.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,240
 No paperwork, no long wait times.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,880
 The SHE Bureau, too benefit from the automated verification and streamlined workflows enabling

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,360
 them to review applications faster and with greater accuracy.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,480
 This is exactly what we, Team CODENITI, aim to achieve with our paperless scholarship

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 disbursement system for the Prime Minister's special scholarships scheme.

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,280
 I'm Jheel Jain and along with my team we have built a system that eliminates the need

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,280
 for manual verification by leveraging technologies like optical character recognition and DigiLocker for

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,000
 secure document authentication.

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,640
 Students can upload the documents directly while the SHE Bureau can automate verification

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,640
 and focus on critical cases by reducing manual steps via ensuring faster, more transparent

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
 and reliable scholarship disbursement.
